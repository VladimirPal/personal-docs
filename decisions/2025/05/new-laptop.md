## Context

My current MacBook Pro 15" (2017, i7, 16GB) is falling apart:  
- Broken keyboard (non-replaceable)
- Dead battery
- Screen glitches  

Despite still having sufficient performance, it's now painful to use.

I don’t need a high-performance replacement — my actual workflow happens on a desktop PC or over SSH into a Raspberry Pi cluster.
I just need a **portable terminal** with a good screen and keyboard to let me move between rooms (e.g., office ↔ bedroom)
and continue working using VSCode/Cursor and vim connected remotely.

Key requirements:
- 15.6" screen (i used to work on macbook pro)
- Runs Linux well with no weird bugs
- Comfortable keyboard
- Cheap
- At least 8GB RAM and SSD
- Acceptable battery life
- Preferably repairable and modulable

## Decision

I decided to buy a **used Lenovo ThinkPad T580 or T590**. These laptops are:

- Cheap (200 - 300 USD)
- Reliable and Linux-compatible
- Feature proper 15.6" FHD matte displays
- Use 8th Gen Intel CPUs (i5-8250U, i7-8550U), which are enough for terminal + VSCode
- Offer good keyboards and build quality
- Easy to upgrade RAM, SSD, and battery

## Consequences

- I get a portable Linux terminal for local/remote dev work
- Low cost (~$250) and easy to replace or repair in future
- May need to replace battery depending on condition
- No fancy GPU or new-gen features, but fits my current life perfectly
