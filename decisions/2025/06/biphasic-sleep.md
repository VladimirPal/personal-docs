# 🛏️ Decision: Adopt Biphasic + Adaptive Sleep Rhythm for 3 Months

## 📝 Context

I've struggled with irregular sleep timing — often flipping to waking at 6pm — despite getting
enough hours overall.  
I enjoy both:

- 🌅 **Mornings** (cool air, clear mind, sunrise energy)
- 🌙 **Nights** (quiet, focus, introspection)

In Vietnam's climate, daytime is often too hot for deep work. I've observed that locals naturally
follow a rhythm involving early wake times and afternoon rest. I want to align with this while
keeping room for occasional late-night focus periods.

## 🎯 Decision

For the next **3 months**, I will follow a **Biphasic Sleep** schedule with an **Adaptive Sleep
Rhythm**, structured as:

### 🌗 Biphasic Core Structure

- **Core sleep**: ~11:00pm → 5:30/6:00am
- **Siesta**: ~12:30pm → 2:00pm (1–1.5h max)

### ↙️ Adaptive Rotation (Monthly)

- **3 weeks** in morning-focused biphasic mode
- **1 week** in night-focused mode (e.g., 3am–10am + siesta)
- Allow 2–3 days for transition in both directions

---

## 📊 Current Phase

✅ Initial transition in progress (brutal no-sleep reset on June 15→16) Target first full biphasic
morning day: June 17.

## ⚠️ Constraints

- Maintain total sleep 6–8h per day
- No frequent random shifts (avoid chaos)
- Light exposure:
  - Get sunlight within 1h of waking
  - Dim/red lighting before sleep

---

## ✨ Expected Benefits

- Sync with natural Vietnamese climate and rhythm
- Preserve both morning clarity and night focus windows
- Reduce stress from irregular patterns
- Improve sleep depth and focus consistency

---

## ⚖️ Risks & Tradeoffs

- Temporary fatigue during transition days
- Risk of "flipping" unintentionally if not disciplined
- Social/work schedule conflicts may need adjustment

---

## 📅 Follow-up Plan

- **June 17–July 7**: Morning-focused biphasic mode
- **July 8–July 10**: Transition to night-focused phase
- **July 11–July 17**: Night-focused mode
- **July 18–28**: Transition back
- Continue cycle monthly...

## 📝 Daily Reflections

### 2025-06-17 (Day 1)

**Time of writing:** 04:50 AM  
**Wake time:** ~01:00 AM  
**Sleep duration:** ~6.5 hours (18:30 → 01:00)

#### 🧭 Summary

First day after the brutal reset. I fell asleep around 6:30 PM after 30+ hours awake. Woke up
naturally at 1:00 AM, stayed in bed till 2:00 AM, then started the day — calm, alert.

Did a night ride to grab food: instant noodles, 2 boiled eggs, tuna, banana. Warm, grounding, light
— felt right. After that, I cleaned up around the house and did a light coding task in bed with a
relaxed headspace.

The house was silent. The city was asleep. I was awake, present, and in rhythm.

#### 🔍 Observations

- Even 6 hours felt enough after full exhaustion — body took what it needed
- Mental state: quiet, sharp, not hungry for dopamine
- Riding a motorbike at night felt powerful

#### 📈 Alignment With Decision

✅ Stayed within core sleep window  
✅ No nap planned before 12:30 PM  
✅ Fully respected the shift without crashing  
✅ Built day 1 as a conscious beginning, not just survival

#### 🕗 Midday Update

**Time of writing:** 08:45 AM  
**Beach time:** 05:00 → 06:40 (~1h 40m)  
**Mood:** Mixed — energized physically, but emotionally irritated

##### 🌅 Morning Activities

Started the day strong — hit the beach early. Thousands of people, almost surreal. Walked, worked
out, barefoot on the sand. Physical state: warm, agile, grounded. Mental clarity peaked after
movement.

Returned home and immediately hit turbulence — the fish drama triggered strong emotional agitation.
Couldn't calm down for a while. Environment clash.

Letting it pass, I shifted to something grounding — working on Fedora setup, slowly prepping for
transition from Windows. Light, focused task with a clear trajectory.

##### 🔍 Observations

- Morning light, fresh air, and movement set a solid tone
- Social/environmental disruption can still hijack mental clarity fast
- Having a fallback routine (light work, configuration) helps realign
- Even after a trigger, staying awake and active avoids collapse

##### 📈 Alignment With Decision

✅ Continued respecting wake time and activity window  
✅ No urge to nap or crash despite emotional spike  
✅ Used morning light and motion for regulation  
✅ Keeping the momentum for the first full biphasic day

### 2025-06-18 (Day 2)

**Time of writing:** 11:30 AM  
**Wake time:** ~04:30 AM  
**Sleep duration:** ~5.5 hours (23:00 → ~04:30)

#### 🧭 Summary

Went to bed right on schedule at 11:00 PM and woke up naturally before 4:30 AM. Sleep quality wasn’t
great — a bit shallow and fragmented — but I still got up without trouble and began the day.

Headed straight to the beach. Walked for a while but didn't work out — body didn't feel up for it.
Still, the movement and air felt good.

Once home, I jumped into urgent work: responded to important emails and handled what couldn't wait.
Then shifted focus into Linux — continuing the setup of my Hyprland environment. Still working on it
as of writing. It's been a deep, continuous focus block.

Planning to lie down around 12:30 PM for siesta. Yesterday I overslept during the siesta, waking up
only at 15:30 — will try to avoid that today.

#### 🔍 Observations

- Sleep felt shallow but still functional; not enough depth, possibly due to body not yet fully
  adapted
- No beach workout today, but the walk helped keep the rhythm alive
- Morning was productive, though not particularly energetic
- Focus came easier once I started light, necessary work

#### 📈 Alignment With Decision

✅ Sleep time aligned with biphasic plan  
✅ Wake time stayed within target range  
✅ Maintained early exposure to daylight and movement  
✅ Skipped workout, but still honored morning rhythm  
⚠️ Risk of siesta oversleep (as happened yesterday — 12:30 → 15:30)  
⚠️ Sleep quality needs improvement — consider adjusting wind-down routine
