## Context

My current visa in Vietnam (Da Nang) will expire on June 11, 2025. I need to extend my stay
in Vietnam for a longer period. The most practical option is to obtain a new single-entry visa
for 3 months through a visa run to the Lao Bao border crossing.

## Decision

I will obtain a new 3-month single entry visa for Vietnam through a visa run to Lao Bao border crossing.
- Taking a bus trip to Lao Bao
- Crossing the border to obtain a new visa
- Cost: 2.9 million VND (~ 111 USD)
- Planned execution date: June 10, 2025
