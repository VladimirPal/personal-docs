## Context

I need to find a new place to live in Vietnam. My current living situation is no longer suitable,
and I need to make a decision about where to move. This involves considering location, budget,
amenities, and timing.

<!-- truncate -->

## Decision

I will rent a new house in Vietnam. I need to:

1. **Research locations**  
   Consider proximity to amenities, beach, safety, noise levels, and infrastructure quality. Key
   areas to explore: My An, An Thuong, Son Tra, or more residential areas if quiet is a priority.

2. **Set budget parameters**  
   My total budget is over **25 million VND/month**. A friend will contribute **5–6 million VND**,
   taking one room. I'm open to signing a **6-month or annual contract** if the place is suitable
   long-term.

3. **Define requirements**

   - At least 2–3 bedrooms
   - Separate working area or studio space
   - Quiet environment
   - Good natural light and ventilation
   - Fast and stable fiber internet (≥ 100 Mbps)
   - Western-style kitchen with good cooking facilities
   - Optional: balcony, yard, or rooftop access

4. **Timeline**

   - Target move-in: **August 2025**
   - Coordinate exit from current lease
   - Allow overlap time of 1–2 weeks for smooth transition

5. **Documentation**
   - Valid passport and visa
   - Prepare cash or bank transfer for **deposit + first month's rent**
   - Request bilingual contract (English/Vietnamese)

## Notes

- Will search via Facebook housing groups, local rental agents, and Vietnamese property websites
- Consider long-term comfort and livability over short-term pricing
- Friend’s requirements also need to be taken into account for shared living
