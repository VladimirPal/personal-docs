# 📅 Daily Pulse — 2025-07-21

## 🎯 Today’s Mission

Light the fire. Restore forward motion on SyncContact, with scoped awareness.

## 🔊 Focus Tasks

- [deep] Write a note in diffs "Vision:IT-Pal"
- [maybe-deep] Review key areas of current SyncContact codebase (set timer!)
- [shallow] Search new houses

## 🧘 Focus Reminder

Today is **not** for breakthroughs — it’s for ignition. 
Start clean. Stay scoped. Let the system breathe.

## ⏱️ Guardrails

- Use a timer when starting [maybe-deep] task
- If over 60 min, pause, log thoughts, switch
- Reward completion of *one* [shallow] task

## 🪪 Pitfall to Watch

“Just fixing this one config” → suddenly it’s 5PM.  
Leave perfection for Sunday configs.
