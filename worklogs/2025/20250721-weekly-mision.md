# Weekly Mission: July 21–27

## 🎯 Objective

Reignite execution on SyncContact and maintain focused momentum.

- Push SyncContact toward monetization strategy
- Maintain housing search with consistent but bounded effort
- Prevent unplanned deep dives — use scoped task awareness

## 🔊 Signal Tasks

- [ ] [deep] Vision, Business strategy and Planning for IT-Pal(SyncContact, Chronos, Matrix)
- [ ] [maybe-deep] SyncContact “Next 3 Milestones” roadmap
- [ ] [deep] Work on SyncContact tasks
- [ ] [maybe-deep] Search a new house in Da Nang

## 🧠 Meta Practices

- ⏱️ Use 45–60 min soft caps for all [shallow] / [maybe-deep] tasks
- 🧭 Timer for [maybe-deep]: `watch -n 60 'date'` or stopwatch app
- 📓 Log curiosity trails & unresolveds in `diffs/` or `@pitfall`
- 🎉 One [shallow] win = minimum bar for success per day

## 🌒 If Overwhelmed

- [ ] Just update the roadmap bullet list for SyncContact
- [ ] Do 25-min focused task (any shallow item)
