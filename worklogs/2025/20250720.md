# 📅 Daily Pulse — 2025-07-20

## 🎯 Today’s Mission

Settle, stabilize, and soften. Use low-pressure focus to quietly reclaim rhythm.

## 🧭 Context

- 🌧️ Rainy morning, light beach workout done
- 🍽️ Hungry — food and comfort first
- ✅ Yesterday, all must-have reminders were handled
- 🌱 Sunday = minimal pressure, cleanup, reset

## 🔊 Signal Tasks (Pick 1–2 only)

- [ ] **Support Inbox Triage** *(carryover)*
  - [ ] Skim for urgent ones only — archive the noise
- [ ] **Relocation exploration (light version)**
  - [ ] Just name 2 possible directions (stay or move)
  - [ ] Write a few lines of your gut feeling today

## 🌿 Weekend Rituals (Recovery Layer)

- [ ] Eat something nourishing and warm
- [ ] Quick room/desk reset (5–10 min max)
- [ ] Gentle walk if rain clears — or stretch instead
- [ ] Skim Reminder Bot output — remove any overload

## ✍️ Optional Bonus

- [ ] Draft raw bullet list of next week’s themes (no pressure to organize yet)

## 🧘 Focus Reminder

Today is just maintenance. Let your mind cool. You already did real work this week. Keep it slow and clean.
